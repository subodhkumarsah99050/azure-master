Step-01
e.g:
Domain name: 
EG_Front_End: abc.com
EG_Front_End_API: abc.com/test/
EG_Front_PHP: abc.com/news/

Step-02:
Get SSL pfx file and it password.

Step-03:
Create Application Gateway with default configutation and set your AG name.

Step-04:
Create Backend pool for all three domain.
Name: EG_Front_End_BP
IP address or FQDN: 1.1.1.1

Name: EG_Front_End_API_BP
IP address or FQDN: 2.2.2.2

Name: EG_Front_PHP_BP
IP address or FQDN: 3.3.3.3

Step-05:
Create Backend Setting for all three domain.
Note: Backend setting will make connection between load balancer to Application Gateway.
That's why we have selected here port "80" because our all load balancer services are running on port 80.

Backend settings name: EG_Front_End_BS
#Backend protocol: HTTP
#Backend port: 80

#Cookie-based affinity: disable
#Connection draining: disable
#Request time-out (seconds): 20
Override backend path: /

Note: All commented line values are default.


Backend settings name: EG_Front_End_API_BS
#Backend protocol: HTTP
#Backend port: 80

#Cookie-based affinity: disable
#Connection draining: disable
#Request time-out (seconds): 20
Override backend path: /



Backend settings name: EG_Front_PHP_BS
#Backend protocol: HTTP
#Backend port: 80

#Cookie-based affinity: disable
#Connection draining: disable
#Request time-out (seconds): 20
Override backend path: /


Step-05:
Create a listner with HTTPS port 443. 
Note: If you want to create more then one listner then selecte different different ports. 
e.g: 444,445 and 446 etc.

Listener name: abc.com_listner
Frontend IP: Public


Protocol: HTTPS

Port: 443
Note: we can change it.

Choose a certificate:
Create new:-
Cert name: abc.com.pfx 
Note: Name can be anything.

PFX certificate file: upload a pfx file from local.

Password: Password@123
Provide a password, which we have provided during creating it.

Rest all keep default.

Click on Add.

Step-06: routing rule
Click on "Add a routing rule"

Rule name: EG_Front_End_Routing_Rule
Priority: 100
Note: Give rule in the interval of 100.
e.g: 100,200,300 etc.

Listener: abc.com_listner
Note: Select listner which we have created.

Configure Backend Target:
Target type: Backend pool
Backend Target: EG_Front_End_BP
Note: Select your Backend pool which you have created.

Backend Setting: EG_Front_End_BS
Note: Select your Backend setting which you have created.

Now configure "Path based rules"

Click on "Add multiple targets to create a path-based rule"

Target type: Backend pool
Path: /*
Target name: EG_Front_End_Target
Backend settings : EG_Front_End_BS
Backend Target: EG_Front_End_BP

Target type: Backend pool
Path: /test/*
Target name: EG_Front_End_API_Target
Backend settings : EG_Front_End_API_BS
Backend Target: EG_Front_End_API_BP

Target type: Backend pool
Path: /news/*
Target name: EG_Front_PHP_Target
Backend settings : EG_Front_PHP_BS
Backend Target: EG_Front_PHP_BP

Once done all these steps then navigate all URLs in browser.
abc.com
abc.com/test/
abc.com/news/


Note: If we using other ports then search with port number.
e.g: port: 444
abc.com:444
abc.com:444/test/
abc.com:444/news/
